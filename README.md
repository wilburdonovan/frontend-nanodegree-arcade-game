##How to Play##

Use the arrow keys to move your player up &uarr;, down &darr;, left &larr; and right &rarr;.

Get your player to the water without touching the bug. Points allocations are as follows:
- Get to the water = 10 points
- Collect a star = 20 points
- Touch a bug = You lose!! Restart

As you accrue points, you level up. Each new level results in faster enemies!! The first level up occurs after 50 pts. Points to reach the next level is:
>2*the points needed for the previous level.
